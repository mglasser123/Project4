Predicting Customer Churn

Scenario: A marketing agency has many customers who use their service to produce ads for customer websites. They've noticed that they have quite a bit of churn in clients. They randomly assign account managers but want to be more strategic by assigning their best account managers to the clients most at risk to churn. They have provided their historical client data, so that we can leverage to build a machine-learning model to quickly identify at-risk customers.
